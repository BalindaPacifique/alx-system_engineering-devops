Postmortem: Outage on Web Stack
Issue Summary
Duration: May 10, 2024, 9:00 AM - May 10, 2024, 11:30 AM (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced a complete outage, rendering it inaccessible to all users. Approximately 80% of our user base was affected.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on one of the backend servers.
Timeline
9:00 AM: Monitoring alerts detected the issue, indicating a sudden spike in server errors.
9:05 AM: Engineers noticed the issue and began investigating.
9:15 AM: Investigated database performance and network connectivity, assuming database issues.
9:45 AM: Upon further investigation, I realized the issue was not with the database but the web server.
10:00 AM: Misleadingly assumed a DDoS attack due to the sudden surge in traffic.
10:30 AM: The incident escalated to the DevOps team as the issue persisted.
11:00 AM: DevOps identified misconfigured load balancer settings, causing uneven distribution of traffic.
11:30 AM: Load balancer settings were corrected, restoring standard functionality to the web application.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The load balancer was misconfigured to route excessive traffic to one of the backend servers, causing it to become overloaded and unresponsive.
Resolution: The misconfigured load balancer settings were corrected, ensuring balanced traffic distribution across all backend servers.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated load balancer configuration checks to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Enhance monitoring and alerting systems to identify and respond to similar issues in the future quickly.
Tasks:
Conduct a thorough review of all load balancer configurations to identify and correct potential misconfigurations.
Implement automated tests to validate load balancer configurations against best practices regularly.
Enhance the monitoring system to provide more granular insights into server performance and traffic distribution.
